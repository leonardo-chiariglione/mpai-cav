// THE TRUST PROTOCOL (MPAI-PTF V1.0, Trust Establishment Protocol; M3223 3.4), as a
// Controller and an AIM host run it when a link between them opens. Each end is a
// Trust Anchor - a Controller is one (the author, 2026/09/25), and so is a host -
// configured with the anchors it trusts: a host, the Controllers it serves; a
// Controller, the hosts it uses. There is no key shared between them.
//
// The Controller sends a TrustRequest, the host answers with a TrustResponse; each
// is signed by its sender's anchor key (KeyID the AnchorID) and checked by the other
// against the anchors it trusts: known, current, signed by that key, fresh. Each
// names the TLS certificate of the other end as its sender sees it - the request,
// the host's; the response, the Controller's - so a message is good only on the TLS
// link it was sent on, and the channel and the identity are the same: a party that
// relays it to a third end presents a certificate the message does not name.
//
// ATTESTED (M3223 3.5): an end with a root of trust presents, beside its message,
// its Trust Anchor object and its Attestation Evidence - the quote of its
// registers over the hash of the other end's certificate, which is the nonce the
// other chose, new for each link. An end that requires attestation refuses a
// message without it, or whose evidence does not prove what it says.
