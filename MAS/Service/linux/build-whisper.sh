# BUILD whisper.cpp 1.9.3 WITH CUDA, ONCE, ON A BUILD MACHINE - not on every server.
# The CUDA build of whisper.cpp is heavy (nvcc compiles the GGML kernels, one process per
# core, each large): a server of modest cores and memory cannot finish it. Build it here,
# for the GPU the servers have, and hand the result to package.sh:
#
#   MAS/Service/linux/build-whisper.sh <out-folder> [cuda-architectures]
#   MPAI_WHISPER_DIR=<out-folder> MAS/Service/linux/package.sh <folder> [install-root]
#
# cuda-architectures: the compute capability of the GPU the servers have - one is much
# lighter to build than all: 75 T4, 80 A100, 86 A10G / RTX A4000-A6000 / RTX 3090,
# 89 L4 / L40S / RTX 4000 Ada / RTX 4080-4090, 90 H100; several as "80;86". Default
# "native": the GPU of this machine (nvidia-smi must find one).
#
# The build machine needs the CUDA toolkit (nvcc), of the same CUDA as the servers' ONNX
# Runtime (package.sh: CUDA 13 by default, CUDA 12 with MPAI_CUDA=12), so that one set of
# CUDA libraries serves both - g++, cmake, curl. For servers with an NVIDIA driver older
# than 580 (550, say): apt cuda-toolkit-12-8, the same 12.8 as the libraries (cuda-libraries-12-8:
# two CUDA 12 versions side by side leave the loader's choice to chance), not 13.
# A server then needs only the CUDA *libraries* (apt: cuda-libraries-13-0) and the NVIDIA
# driver: no nvcc, no g++, no cmake. <out-folder>/bin receives whisper-cli, whisper-server
# and whisper.build ("cuda-prebuilt"), which tells setup.sh not to build again.
